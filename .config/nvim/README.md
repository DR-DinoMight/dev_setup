# NeoVim config

This is my NeoVim config. Feel free to use it, or not. Mostly this is here as a backup.

* Clone this into `~/.config/nvim`
* Run `./setup.sh`
* Enjoy

## Pre-requisites

* Git
* Node & Yarn
* Prettier

## Notes

This will probably turn into my quick setup for linux, but just starting with neovim config for now
